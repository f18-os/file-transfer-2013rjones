This folder consists of several programs. One of which is a framedClient.py and a framedServer.py. These when ran and attached to the same socket can transfer files from the client to the server. 

To run the program type: 
    python framedServer.py
In another terminal/buffer type 
    python framedClient.py

Then by typing in the corresponding sockets and ip addresses these two can be linked together to transfer files.
